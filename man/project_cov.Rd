\title{Project a Covariance Matrix (generic)}
\usage{
project_cov(x, new_data, ...)

\method{project_cov}{covstatis}(x, new_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A model object for which a `project_cov` method exists (e.g.
an object of class `covstatis`).}

\item{new_data}{A symmetric numeric matrix to be projected.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of projected scores.

A numeric matrix of projected scores with dimensions \code{nrow(new_data)} Ã— \code{ncomp}.
}
\description{
Generic for projecting a new covariance matrix onto a previously fitted
`covstatis` model.
}
\details{
For \code{covstatis} objects, a new covariance/correlation matrix is transformed using
the same preprocessing steps (centering and normalization) as were applied during
model fitting, then projected onto the model space. This returns the "partial factor scores"
or ROI-level coordinates for the new subject.
