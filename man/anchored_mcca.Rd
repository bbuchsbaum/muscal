\usage{
anchored_mcca(
  Y,
  X,
  row_index,
  preproc = multivarious::center(),
  ncomp = 2,
  ridge = 1e-06,
  block_weights = NULL,
  use_future = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix/data.frame (`N × q`) serving as the reference block.}

\item{X}{A list of numeric matrices/data.frames. Each element `X[[k]]` is `n_k × p_k`.}

\item{row_index}{A list of integer vectors. `row_index[[k]]` has length `n_k`
and maps rows of `X[[k]]` to rows of `Y` (values in `1..N`).}

\item{preproc}{A `multivarious` preprocessing pipeline (a `pre_processor`/`prepper`)
or a list of them. If a list, it must have length `1 + length(X)` and will be
applied to `c(list(Y), X)` in that order.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer; number of canonical components to compute.}

\item{ridge}{Non-negative numeric scalar (or vector of length equal to the
number of blocks) controlling ridge stabilization. The effective ridge used
per block is scaled by the block's overall energy so the default works
across variable scalings.}

\item{block_weights}{Optional numeric vector of non-negative weights. If unnamed
and of length `length(X)`, it is interpreted as weights for `X` blocks and `Y`
is given weight 1. If of length `1 + length(X)`, the first weight corresponds to `Y`.}

\item{use_future}{Logical; if `TRUE`, block-wise computations are performed via
`furrr::future_map()` when available.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments forwarded to [aligned_mcca()] (currently unused).}
}
\value{
An object of class `"anchored_mcca"` (and `"aligned_mcca"`).
}
\description{
Convenience wrapper around [aligned_mcca()] for the common case with a fully
observed reference block `Y` (e.g., stimulus features) and one or more linked
blocks `X_k` (e.g., brain data). Rows of each `X_k` are linked to rows of `Y`
via `row_index[[k]]`.

Compared to the legacy name "linked", "anchored" makes explicit that the
shared scores live in the row space of `Y` (with `N = nrow(Y)`).
