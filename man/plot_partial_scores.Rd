\title{Plot Partial Factor Scores}
\usage{
plot_partial_scores(
  x,
  dims = c(1, 2),
  blocks = NULL,
  connect = TRUE,
  show_consensus = TRUE,
  alpha = 0.6,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted `mfa` or `linked_mfa` object.}

\item{dims}{Integer vector of length 2 for component axes.}

\item{blocks}{Which blocks to include. `NULL` means all blocks.}

\item{connect}{Logical; if `TRUE`, draw lines connecting the same
observation across blocks.}

\item{show_consensus}{Logical; if `TRUE`, show the global scores as larger points.}

\item{alpha}{Transparency for partial score points.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (if ggplot2 available) or base R plot.
}
\description{
Displays how each block "sees" the observations. For MFA, this shows
block-specific projections. For Linked MFA, connects auxiliary block
observations to their reference positions.
}
\details{
For MFA: Each block's partial scores are computed by projecting that block
alone onto the compromise space. Observations where partial scores diverge
indicate block disagreement.

For Linked MFA
the auxiliary block observations are shown at their
projected positions, with lines connecting to the reference score.
