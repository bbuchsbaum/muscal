\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numeric matrix/data.frame (`N × q`) serving as the reference block.}

\item{X}{A list of numeric matrices/data.frames. Each element `X[[k]]` is `n_k × p_k`.}

\item{row_index}{A list of integer vectors. `row_index[[k]]` has length `n_k`
and maps rows of `X[[k]]` to rows of `Y` (values in `1..N`).}

\item{preproc}{A `multivarious` preprocessing pipeline (a `pre_processor`/`prepper`)
or a list of them. If a list, it must have length `1 + length(X)` and will be
applied to `c(list(Y), X)` in that order.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer number of components to extract.}

\item{normalization}{Block weighting scheme. `"MFA"` uses inverse squared first
singular value per block; `"None"` uses uniform weights; `"custom"` uses `alpha`.}

\item{alpha}{Optional numeric vector of per-block weights (length `1 + length(X)`),
used when `normalization = "custom"`. The first weight corresponds to `Y`.}

\item{feature_groups}{Feature prior specification. One of:
* `NULL` (no feature prior),
* `"colnames"` to group X-features with identical column names across blocks,
* a `data.frame` with columns `block`, `feature`, `group` and optional `weight`.
  `block` refers to a name or index in `X` (not including `Y`), and `feature` is
  a column name or index within that block.}

\item{feature_lambda}{Non-negative scalar controlling strength of the feature prior.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of alternating least-squares iterations.}

\item{tol}{Relative tolerance on the objective for convergence.}

\item{ridge}{Non-negative ridge stabilization added to normal equations.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if `TRUE`, prints iteration progress.}

\item{...}{Unused (reserved for future extensions).}
}
\value{
An object inheriting from `multivarious::multiblock_biprojector` with
  additional classes `"anchored_mfa"` and `"linked_mfa"`. The object contains global scores in `s`,
  concatenated loadings in `v`, and block mappings in `block_indices`. Additional
  fields include `V_list`, `B`, `row_index`, `alpha_blocks`, and `objective_trace`.
}
\description{
Anchored MFA generalizes Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA) to the case where a single
reference block `Y` (with `N` rows) is linked to multiple blocks `X_k` that may
have different numbers of rows. Each row of `X_k` is mapped to a row of `Y` via
an index vector `row_index[[k]]`. The model estimates a shared score matrix
`S` for the rows of `Y` and block-specific loading matrices for `Y` and each `X_k`.

Optionally, a feature prior can be provided to encourage corresponding or
similar features across different `X_k` blocks to have similar loading vectors.
}
\details{
## Model
The fitted model has the form:
\deqn{Y \approx S B^\top}
\deqn{X_k \approx S[\mathrm{idx}_k,] V_k^\top}
where `S` is `N × ncomp`, `B` is `q × ncomp`, and each `V_k` is `p_k × ncomp`.

## Feature similarity prior (v1)
When `feature_lambda > 0` and `feature_groups` is supplied, Anchored MFA applies
a group-shrinkage penalty that pulls the loading vectors of features in the same
group toward a shared group center.

`linked_mfa()` is a legacy alias for [anchored_mfa()] retained for backward
compatibility.
