\title{Low-rank reconstruction of the compromise matrix}
\usage{
\method{reconstruct}{covstatis}(x, comp = 1:multivarious::ncomp(x))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted `covstatis` model}

\item{comp}{Integer vector of component indices to retain}
}
\value{
A matrix of the same size as each input matrix, representing 
        a low-rank approximation of the compromise matrix in the preprocessed space
        (after double-centering and normalization, if they were applied)
}
\description{
Recreates the compromise matrix using only the selected components.
