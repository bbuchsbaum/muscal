\arguments{
\item{X}{A list of numeric matrices/data.frames. Each element `X[[k]]` is
`n_k × p_k`.}

\item{row_index}{A list of integer vectors. `row_index[[k]]` has length `n_k`
and maps rows of `X[[k]]` to shared rows in `1..N`.}

\item{N}{Optional integer specifying the number of shared rows. If `NULL`
(default), `N` is inferred as `max(unlist(row_index))`.}

\item{preproc}{A `multivarious` preprocessing pipeline (a `pre_processor`/`prepper`)
or a list of them. If a list, it must have length `length(X)` and will be
applied to `X` in that order.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer number of components to extract.}

\item{normalization}{Block weighting scheme. `"MFA"` uses inverse squared first
singular value per block; `"None"` uses uniform weights; `"custom"` uses `alpha`.}

\item{alpha}{Optional numeric vector of per-block weights (length `length(X)`),
used when `normalization = "custom"`.}

\item{feature_groups}{Feature prior specification. One of:
* `NULL` (no feature prior),
* `"colnames"` to group features with identical column names across blocks,
* a `data.frame` with columns `block`, `feature`, `group` and optional `weight`.}

\item{feature_lambda}{Non-negative scalar controlling strength of the feature prior.}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum number of alternating least-squares iterations.}

\item{tol}{Relative tolerance on the objective for convergence.}

\item{ridge}{Non-negative ridge stabilization added to normal equations.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if `TRUE`, prints iteration progress.}

\item{...}{Unused (reserved for future extensions).}
}
\value{
An object inheriting from `multivarious::multiblock_biprojector` with
  additional class `"aligned_mfa"`. The object contains global scores in `s`,
  concatenated loadings in `v`, and block mappings in `block_indices`.
  Additional fields include `V_list`, `row_index`, `alpha_blocks`, and
  `objective_trace`.
}
\description{
Aligned MFA estimates a shared score matrix for a set of *latent reference rows*
when multiple blocks have different row sets. Each block `X[[k]]` is linked to
the shared rows via an integer index vector `row_index[[k]]`, but **no single
block is privileged** as an anchor.

This is the symmetric counterpart to [anchored_mfa()], which uses an explicit
reference block `Y` and estimates scores in the row space of `Y`.
}
\details{
## Model
The fitted model has the form:
\deqn{X_k \approx S[\mathrm{idx}_k,] V_k^\top}
where `S` is `N × ncomp`, each `V_k` is `p_k × ncomp`, and `idx_k` maps rows of
`X_k` to `1..N`. Repeated indices are allowed (e.g., repeated measures), and
contributions are aggregated in the score updates.

## Feature similarity prior
When `feature_lambda > 0` and `feature_groups` is supplied, Aligned MFA applies
the same group-shrinkage penalty as [anchored_mfa()], pulling loading vectors
of grouped features toward a shared group center.
