\title{Project a Subject-Level Covariate (generic)}
\usage{
project_covariate(x, y, ...)

\method{project_covariate}{covstatis}(
  x,
  y,
  what = c("dimension", "observation"),
  scale = c("cosine", "beta"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model object (e.g., `covstatis`).}

\item{y}{Numeric vector representing the covariate, with length equal to the number of subjects in the model.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed to methods.}

\item{what}{`"dimension"` (default) returns cosine / β per compromise
dimension; `"observation"` returns an ROI-wise pattern.}

\item{scale}{`"cosine"` (−1…1) or `"beta"` (regression coeff.).}
}
\value{
The return value depends on the method, but is typically a projection
  of the covariate onto the model's components or a spatial pattern.

If `what = "dimension"`, a named numeric vector of length `ncomp(x)`.
        If `what = "observation"`, an `R × ncomp` matrix.
}
\description{
Generic for projecting a subject-level covariate into the space of a fitted model,
treating it as a supplementary variable without re-fitting the model.

This function projects a subject-level covariate into the space of a fitted `covstatis` model,
treating it as a supplementary variable without re-fitting the model.
}
\details{
The interpretation of the output depends on the `what` parameter:
- **Dimension-wise cosine**: This is the correlation between the covariate `y` and the subject G-scores. It indicates which compromise dimensions are most strongly associated with the covariate.
- **Observation matrix**: This is a weighted sum of each subject's partial factor scores (`Partial-F`). It represents the spatial signature in the compromise space associated with a one-unit change in the covariate.

\examples{
# Create a list of correlation matrices
Xs <- lapply(1:5, function(i) matrix(rnorm(10*10), 10, 10))
Xs <- lapply(Xs, cor)

# Apply COVSTATIS
res <- covstatis(Xs, ncomp=3)

# Create a random covariate vector (e.g., episodic memory scores)
y <- rnorm(length(Xs))

# Project the covariate to get dimension-wise coordinates
dim_cos <- project_covariate(res, y, what = "dimension", scale = "cosine")

# Project the covariate to get an ROI-wise pattern
roi_beta <- project_covariate(res, y, what = "observation", scale = "beta")
