}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Number of subjects/blocks to generate.}

\item{n}{Number of observations (rows) per block.}

\item{sigma}{The standard deviation of the noise added to the data.}

\item{k_nn}{number of nearest neighbors for spatial correlations.}

\item{p_list}{A list of integers specifying the number of variables (columns) for each block.}

\item{ncomp}{The rank of the shared component structure.}

\item{g_list}{A list specifying the shared structure for each block, where each element is a matrix of size \eqn{p_i \times ncomp}.}

\item{u}{A matrix of size \eqn{n \times ncomp} representing the subject-specific scores on the shared components.}

\item{orthogonal_space}{Logical; if TRUE, the block-specific scores are orthogonal to the shared scores.}

\item{A}{A matrix of size \eqn{p_i \times p_i} used to induce spatial correlation (if `spatial=TRUE`).}

\item{...}{extra arguments.}

\item{spatial}{whether to add spatial correlations.}
}
\value{
A list of matrices, where each matrix is a data block.
}
\description{
This helper function creates several blocks of multivariate data that share
a common set of latent factor scores.  Optionally the variables can be placed
on the unit sphere to yield spatial coordinates and a sparse k-nearest-neighbour
graph.  The returned object also contains the ground-truth loadings and scores
used for simulation.
