\arguments{
\item{data}{A data object for which an MCCA method is defined. Typically a
`list` of matrices/data frames or a `multiblock` object.}

\item{preproc}{A preprocessing pipeline from the multivarious package. Each
block is preprocessed independently.}

\item{ncomp}{Integer; the number of canonical components to compute.}

\item{ridge}{Non-negative numeric scalar (or vector of length equal to the
number of blocks) controlling ridge stabilization. The effective ridge used
per block is scaled by the block's overall energy so the default works
across variable scalings.}

\item{block_weights}{Optional numeric vector of non-negative weights (length
= number of blocks) controlling each block's influence on the compromise.}

\item{use_future}{Logical; if `TRUE`, block-wise computations are performed via
`furrr::future_map()` when available.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the underlying method.}
}
\value{
An object inheriting from class `mcca`.
}
\description{
A generic front-end for **multiblock canonical correlation analysis** (MCCA),
also known as generalized CCA (GCCA). Concrete methods should estimate a
compromise score space shared across multiple data blocks that have the same
observations (rows) but potentially different variables (columns).
}
\details{
The reference implementation in this package uses a ridge-stabilized MAXVAR
GCCA formulation that remains well-posed when blocks have more variables than
rows (\\eqn{p \\gg n}) or are rank-deficient after preprocessing (e.g.,
centering).

The \code{mcca.list} method applies MCCA to a list of data matrices or data frames.
This method first converts the list to a \code{multiblock} object and then calls
\code{mcca.multiblock()}.

The \code{mcca.multiblock} method implements a ridge-stabilized MAXVAR generalized
CCA. Internally it computes a compromise score space by eigendecomposition of
a weighted sum of block projection operators:
\deqn{H = \sum_s w_s \, X_s (X_s^T X_s + \kappa_s I)^{-1} X_s^T.}

The ridge parameter is applied per block as \eqn{\kappa_s = \text{ridge}_s \cdot
\bar{d}_s}, where \eqn{\bar{d}_s} is the mean diagonal of the block Gram matrix
\eqn{X_s X_s^T}. This scaling makes the default ridge behave reasonably across
different variable scalings.
